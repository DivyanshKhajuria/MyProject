#Portfolio
This is one of the first project that i made.

The key parts of this projects are the backend was developed with the help of Django Framework and Python.
The frontend part uses HTML, CSS for styling purposes and JavaScript to make it interactive.
I used SQLite3 as a database engine which comes pre-installed in python by default.

This Code can be run by using {python manage.py runserver}command on the terminal.

You can setup the django administration by adding a Superuser by using {python manage.py createsuperuser}

And the Django administration can be accessed by adding "admin" in URL after the IP Adress and then adding your credientials.

Thanks for the visit..!
